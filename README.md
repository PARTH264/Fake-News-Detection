# Fake News Detection

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting fake news using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The pipeline involves text preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training.

## Features
- **Text Preprocessing and Cleaning**
- **Word Cloud Visualization**
- **Bag of Words (BoW) Feature Extraction**
- **Machine Learning Models:**
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
- **Deep Learning Models**
- **Model Comparison**

## Installation
To set up the project, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-news-detection.git
cd fake-news-detection
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook to execute the pipeline:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open the `Fake_News_Detection.ipynb` file and follow the steps inside the notebook.

## Dataset
This project requires a dataset containing news articles labeled as real or fake. Ensure the dataset is available in the appropriate directory before running the models.

## Models
- **Machine Learning:** Logistic Regression and Random Forest are implemented.
- **Deep Learning:** Additional deep learning models are included for performance comparison.

## Results
A comparison of the models' accuracy and performance is provided in the notebook.
